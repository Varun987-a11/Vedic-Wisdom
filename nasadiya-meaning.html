No Being was, nor yet Non-Being then,
No space stretched forth, no firmament was seen.
What shrouded all? Where did the ocean sway?
In depths profound, where nothing held its way?
Neither dust nor sky, nor form beyond,
Only the Question, echoing beyond.</pre>

No death was known, no Immortality's dream,
No sign of Night, no morning's waking gleam.
That ONE breathed breathless, moved by its own power,
Beyond that Single Source, there was no hour.
No wind stirred air, no dual time began,
Just self-sustaining Essence, before the plan.</pre>

Darkness concealed deep darkness at the core,
A vast, unformed, un-distinguished shore.
The All was Water, wrapped in empty shell,
The Germ that lay obscured, waiting to tell.
Then, by the Greatness of its Inner Fire (Tapas),
That single Substance rose, driven higher.</pre>

            <pre class="poetic-text">
Desire, the first seed, rose within the Mind,
The primal force, for all creation designed.
The Sages sought, with wisdom in their heart,
To find the Kinship that set Being apart.
They traced the line, the boundary dimly vast,
Between the Unseen Nothing and the form that's cast.</pre>

Their cosmic Ray expanded, stretched across,
Was it beneath? Or did it know no loss?
Seed-Bearers arose, and Mighty Forces too,
Below was self-sustaining Might, above was effort new.
The deep potential (Svadha) was below the line,
The Will to Act (Paryati) was the supreme design.</pre>

Who truly knows? Who here can well declare?
From whence this vast creation did appear?
The Gods themselves arose when this was made,
So who can pierce the mystery, unafraid?
The primal source, the origin untold—
Did it proceed from something new or something old?</pre>

The mighty Overseer, in highest Heaven's sphere,
He surely knows, or does He hold it dear?
From whom this great projection came to be,
Whether He formed it, or did not, we see—
He is the Chief, the Lord of all we name,
Yet even He may not recall the primal flame.</pre>
